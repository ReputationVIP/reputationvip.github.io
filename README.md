# ReputationVIP R&D blog

## Description

This repository contains the source code and articles which run
[http://reputationvip.io](http://reputationvip.io).
This blog is powered by Jekyll and hosted on Github pages. Our current
theme is based on the work of
[Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/) and its
[Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

## Development

In order to ease development and article draft writing locally,
we provide a basic dockerized stack to get you started in just a single
command:

```
docker-compose up
```

The website is then accessible on your localhost, under port 80.
