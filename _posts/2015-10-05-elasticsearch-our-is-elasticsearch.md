# OUR IS ELASTICSEARCH

Welcome back! This article, the third one over my set of articles about Elasticsearch, will introduce you some more advanced concepts
about Elasticsearch.

In the two last articles, I guided you through the basic configuration of an Elasticsearch cluster, how to configure it, how to do mapping,
how to perform CRUD operations, and finally, how to execute simple full-text search queries.

If you don't remember well about these notions, I recommend you to read the previous articles:

- [Elasticsearch Is Coming](http://reputationvip.io/elasticsearch-is-coming/)
- [Elasticsearch Always Pays Its Debts](http://reputationvip.io/elasticsearch-always-pays-its-debts/)
