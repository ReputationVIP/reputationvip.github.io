# OUR IS ELASTICSEARCH

Welcome back! This article, the third one over my set of articles about Elasticsearch, will introduce you some more advanced concepts
about Elasticsearch.

In the two last articles, I guided you through the basic configuration of an Elasticsearch cluster, how to configure it, how to do mapping,
how to perform CRUD operations, and finally, how to execute simple full-text search queries.

If you don't remember well about these notions, I recommend you to read the previous articles:

- [Elasticsearch Is Coming](http://reputationvip.io/elasticsearch-is-coming/)
- [Elasticsearch Always Pays Its Debts](http://reputationvip.io/elasticsearch-always-pays-its-debts/)

## ROADMAP

As I just said, this article adds itself to the two previous ones. Without no more waiting, let's take a look at the menu.

- **Routing** will be the first subject I will be talking about in this article. I will detail you why and how your can configure
the way your data are spread among the cluster.
- **Tree-like index structures** and **nested objects** will be my second subject. Indeed, we haven't go through every Elasticsearch data types yet.
- **Scoring** will be my third theoretical subject. I will detail you how much the choice of a scoring function is important.
- **Compound Queries** are some more complicated queries //TODO COMPLETE THIS EXCERPT ABOUT COMPOUND QUERIES
- **Scripting** will be at the end of this article... And honestly, I can't wait to talk about it!

Ok, Elasticsearch fans, get ready to dive even deeper in the fabulous world of Elasticsearch!
