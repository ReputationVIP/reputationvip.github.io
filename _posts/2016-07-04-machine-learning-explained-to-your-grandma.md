At Reputation VIP, we absolutly love trending technologies. Among them, one of
the most famous since a few years is called Machine Learning. For most of us, Machine
Learning looks like a magic box, able to solve almost any problem : Speech
Recognition, Fraud Detection, ... One of them, known as "Google Deep Dream" is
able to... "dream" !

But, is Machine Learning that much magical ? Let's see...

In this first set of slides, I've been working on demystifying the so called
Machine Learning. No mathematics, no weird information theory nor neural network,
just a bit of culture about Machine Learning.

In the second set of slides, I am going through the simplest model of Machine Learning : Regressions, and specifically linear models.
